h1. lane_groove

Put your config-files as yaml into one dir, cd to this dir and enter @lane_groove@:

<pre><code>$: lane_groove 
[26/07 17:40:41] Working directory is /Users/niko/laut/config_server/config
=> Pid not found, process seems don't exist!
=> Process demonized with pid 92822 with Forever v.0.2.3</code></pre>

The lane_groove daemon gets started on port 6666, a log and a pid file get generated within the same dir. Get the config via http:

<pre><code>curl localhost:6666/.yaml</code></pre>

Supported formats are json, xml, XML (capitalized xml; don't ask), yaml and rb.

Stop the lane_groove server: @lane_groove stop@.

Requests are restricted to the local network (127.0.0.1 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16). For more security… uhm… use a firewall or something.

Requirements are xml-simple, sinatra and rack-contrib. For test rack-test.
